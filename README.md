&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Almost all the mathematics describing the spin of an individual electron can be deduced from the experiment
<b>Stern-Gerlach</b>. In the presented software models, this experiment is shown in a slightly different form
than it is described in most books and articles. But this does not change the essence of the experiment.
In addition, from the above Stern-Gerlach model, it can be seen that this experiment is surprisingly suitable
for understanding the <b><em>Bloch sphere</b></em>, which in the best way visually represents mathematics
the quantum spin of an individual electron.
</p>
<p>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The article consists of four parts
</p>
<p>
&ensp;&ensp;In the  <a href=" https://vlad0007.github.io/BlochSphereOnline/QS_Part1/QS_Part1.html"> <span class=brown>first part</span> </a>, the online program model of the Stern-Gerlach experiment is considered in detail. The three-dimensional visualization of this experiment
is made in such a way that on its basis a three-dimensional visualization
of the Bloch sphere is obtained quite naturally.
</p>
<p>
&ensp;&ensp;<a href=" https://vlad0007.github.io/BlochSphereOnline/QS_Part2/QS_Part2.html"> <span class=brown>The second part</span> </a> shows how the basic formulas for calculating the electron spin are obtained from the software model.
For this purpose, the program model from the first part is viewed from a slightly different point of view.
</p>
<p>
&ensp;&ensp;In the <a href=" https://vlad0007.github.io/BlochSphereOnline/QS_Part3/QS_Part3.html"> <span class=brown>third part</span> </a> a model is made consisting of two separate programs that can
switch between each other. The first of them basically repeats the program model from the first part.
And the second program is a online model of the Bloch-Riemann sphere. It allows you to produce
<em><b>quantum rotations</b></em> on the Bloch sphere and, at the same time, shows the representation of these rotations on the 
complex plane. Switching between the two programs makes it possible to better understand the deep connection of the Stern-Gerlach experiment
with the Bloch sphere.
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;In the program model given in the first part, only the Stern-Gerlach experiment is shown and
the transition to the Bloch sphere is blocked. In the third part, the transition to the Bloch sphere is unlocked. Therefore, it
is possible to carry out both the Stern-Gerlach experiment and quantum rotations on the Bloch sphere at the same time.
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;In the <a href=" https://vlad0007.github.io/BlochSphereOnline/QS_Part3/QS_Part3.html"> <span class=brown>third part</span> </a>, special attention is paid to the visualization of quantum rotations.
Quantum rotations are of particular importance because each spin rotation can be associated
with a one-qubit quantum gate and vice versa, each quantum rotation corresponds to a quantum gate.
Understanding the mechanism of quantum rotations helps to understand the basis of quantum computing.

<p>
&ensp;&ensp;The <a href=" https://vlad0007.github.io/BlochSphereOnline/QS_Part4/QS_Part4.html"> <span class=brown>fourth part</span> </a> contains solutions to exercises 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 from the book by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman "<b>Quantum Mechanics</b>".
Solutions to these exercises are not given in their book.
But the very simple mathematics used in solving these exercises makes it possible to better understand the essence
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors when describing quantum spin.

&ensp;&ensp;Susskind and Friedman's book was the main source of information when creating this site.

I also used the lectures given on <em>youtube</em> by the author under the nickname <em>lightcone</em> on quantum mechanics

&ensp;&ensp;The material of this site is largely borrowed from my <a href="https://vlad0007.github.io/QuantumSpin/" target="_blank"> previous work </a>.
Some bugs have been fixed in this site and new program features have been added. This is especially true of the fourth part.
The program of this part introduces online quantum rotation around an arbitrary axis in the browser. 
I have never come across a program with such an opportunity on the Internet.
